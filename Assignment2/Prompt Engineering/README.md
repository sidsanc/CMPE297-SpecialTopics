In the [PromptCritique notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sidsanc/CMPE297-SpecialTopics/blob/main/Assignment2/Prompt%20Engineering/PromptCritique.ipynb), I developed an interactive tool for refining and critiquing prompts using OpenAI's ChatGPT. This notebook is developed following the best practices and guidelines surveyed by ChatGPT 4 as discussed in this [Coffee Time Chat](https://chat.openai.com/share/a85bd35d-9fa4-4b9f-a505-75a9e04665c1)

Key Features:

`critique_prompt Function`: Interacts with GPT-4 to critique and suggest improvements for a given prompt.

`Interactive UI with Gradio`: Users input their prompts and receive real-time feedback.

`History Tracking`: Maintains a record of user inputs, GPT suggestions, and user responses for iterative refinement.

`Enhanced User Experience`: Integrated features like the "Refine" button to further refine prompts based on GPT suggestions.

_This notebook serves as a practical application of prompt engineering, showcasing the power of conversational AI in refining user prompts._
