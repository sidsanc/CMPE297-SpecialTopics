# NanoGPT Implementations

## Overview
NanoGPT is a minimal implementation of the GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) architecture. This repository provides implementations of NanoGPT in three popular deep-learning frameworks: PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX/Flax.

## Implementations
### 1. [NanoGPT with PyTorch](./NanoGPT_PyTorch.ipynb)
This implementation uses the PyTorch deep learning framework, leveraging its dynamic computation graph and extensive library support.

### 2. [NanoGPT with TensorFlow](./NanoGPT_TensorFlow.ipynb)
In this notebook, NanoGPT is implemented using TensorFlow and the Keras API, providing a static computation graph and robust scalability.

### 3. [NanoGPT with JAX/Flax](./NanoGPT_JAX.ipynb)
The JAX/Flax implementation showcases the functional API and just-in-time compilation capabilities of the JAX library with the neural network API provided by Flax.

## Setup and Installation
To run the notebooks, ensure you have the respective deep learning libraries installed:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision
pip install tensorflow
pip install jax jaxlib flax
```
