# 🚀 Prompt Engineering Techniques with GPT Models

This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks 📓 that demonstrate a variety of advanced prompt engineering techniques utilized with OpenAI's GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 language models. Each notebook is crafted to showcase a specific prompting strategy, aiming to enhance the AI's performance 🎯 in generating accurate, relevant, and context-aware content across different domains.

- ICL (In-Context Learning): ICL prompts are designed to teach the model a pattern within the prompt itself, leading to improved responses without additional training. 📈

- CoT (Chain of Thought): This technique encourages the AI to "think out loud," outlining its reasoning process step-by-step for complex problem-solving tasks. 💭

- iCoT (Iterated Chain of Thought): An advanced form of CoT where the AI refines its initial thoughts through iteration, enhancing accuracy. 🔁

- ToT (Tail of Thought): The model is prompted to continue a thought process, often used in narrative and story-telling contexts. 📖

- GoT (Graph of Thought): Prompts that guide the AI to explore connections between multiple concepts in a structured manner. 🌐

- AoT (Argument of Thought): Used to develop arguments or persuasive content, prompting the model to present a viewpoint with supporting reasons. 🗣️

- RASCEF (Role, Audience, Style, Content, Emotion, Format): A technique that defines these six elements to tailor the AI's tone, style, and content. 🎭

- REACT (Reason, Example, Argument, Counterargument, Tie-back): A framework that guides the AI in constructing well-rounded responses or essays. 📚

- Prompt Patterns and Techniques: Explore a diverse set of prompting patterns such as Zero-Shot, Template, Semantic Filter, Cognitive Verifier, and many others to elicit specific types of responses.

- PALM 2 API: Utilize Google's PALM 2 API for generating text, showcasing its capabilities in creating contextually rich and nuanced content.
